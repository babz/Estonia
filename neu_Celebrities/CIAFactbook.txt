Background:
After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. 
Forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it regained its 
freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia 
has been free to promote economic and political ties with the West. It joined both NATO and the EU in the 
spring of 2004.

wastewater discharged to water bodies in 2000 was 1/20 the level of 1980; in connection with the start-up of new water 
purification plants, the pollution load of wastewater decreased; Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and manmade lakes, 
the smaller of which in agricultural areas need to be monitored; coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations
